# Artemis
Artemis adds support for several games to a range of RGB keyboards.

Besides game-support there are also a few effects for when you're not gaming. 

Some of it's basic features:

 * Support for multiple keyboards planned.
 * Support for multiple games.
 * A few non-gaming effects such as type waves and audio visualization.
 * A fancy, modern looking UI.


Currently the following games are supported:

 * Rocket League (Memory reading)
 * The Witcher 3 (Memory reading)
 * Counter-Strike Global Offensive (Native Gamestate intergration)

Support is planned for:
 * Dota 2 (Native Gamestate intergration)
 * Project CARS (Native memory sharing)

Currently the only supported keyboard is the Logitech G910 Orion Spark, but progress is being made to support Corsair and Razer as well.

For any keyboards/games/effects we'd love PRs!
