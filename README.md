# Artemis
Artemis adds support for several games to a range of RGB keyboards.

Besides game-support there are also a few (rather gimicky) effects for when you're not gaming. 

Some of it's basic features:

 * Support for multiple keyboards planned.
 * Support for multiple games.
 * A few non-gaming effects such as type waves and audio visualization.
 * A fancy, modern looking UI.


Currently the following games are supported:

 * Rocket League
 * The Witcher 3

Support is planned for:
 * Counter-Strike Global Offensive (Using native Gamestate intergration)
 * Dota 2 (Using native Gamestate intergration)
 * Project CARS (Using native memory sharing)

Currently the only supported keyboard is the Logitech G910 Orion Spark, but progress is being made to support Corsair as well.

For any other keyboards feel free to submit a PR.
